Introduction "
# Pattern matching tip
You can solve this level using the knowledge you've aquired so far. If you've used a language with destructuring or pattern matching before, then you can introduce and pattern-match in one step with `intro ⟨nq, p⟩`. Doing so means you won't need the `cases` tactic for this level.
